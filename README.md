# Keylogger

Keylogger is a computer program that record the keystroke typed by the user,

I made this keylogger so it can directly send the keystoke to the inbox of a specified gmail account


you simply need to change:

in ```sender_email``` change "FILL" to sender email,

in ```password``` change "FILL" to the password of the gmail account so it can send the keystroke,

in ```receiver_email``` change "FILL" to receiver email so it can receive the keystroke (can be the same as sender_email),



Thank youu :)
